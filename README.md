This is a prototype of a simple arbitrage strategy, where we look for price distortions for a given BASE/QUOTE pair in different exchanges.

Curently using Binance, FTX and Kucoin REST APIs.

Order handling and Quantity criteria still to be implemented.

Executing among different exchanges will require efficient:
- processing (minimize latency) and;
- capital allocation (guarantee returns).
